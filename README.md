# Real-Time Stock Data Pipeline with PySpark

**Overview**  
This project showcases a real-time data streaming pipeline that captures, processes, and analyzes stock market data in near-real-time. By leveraging PySparkâ€™s distributed processing capabilities and integrating a Telegram Bot for instant alerts, this pipeline demonstrates how to efficiently handle financial time-series data at scale.

**Features**  
- **Continuous Data Streaming:** Fetches minute-level stock data from Yahoo Finance for multiple tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG).  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Computes price spikes, volume surges, volatility shifts, and moving average crossovers.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically identifies significant market changes and logs them for further analysis.  
- **Instant Alerts via Telegram:** Sends critical alerts directly to a Telegram channel, providing stakeholders with timely market insights.  
- **Daily Summary Reports:** Generates end-of-day reports to review key metrics and anomalies, delivered as a concise PDF.  
- **Scalable and Extensible:** Built on PySpark to handle large datasets, with a modular design to easily integrate additional analytics or data sources.

**Integration with Telegram**  
Using the Telegram Bot API, the pipeline sends alerts directly to a specified Telegram channel. This ensures that analysts, traders, and other stakeholders are promptly informed of important market events. The bot is configured to send messages whenever predefined conditions are met, and the process can be easily customized by adjusting alert thresholds or adding new analytics.
